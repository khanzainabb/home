		<h3> Light </h3>
			<h4> The lighting of a photo greatly effects its appearence. Front lighting, or placing the subject so that light is directly in front of the person or object, brings out the detail. ctly in the front, the shadows fall behind the object, so there arenâ€™t any shadows in the image to conceal any details. Front lighting is the simplest to shoot, however, it sometimes looks rather flat or boring. </h4> 
		<h3> Zoom Feature </h3>
			<h4> Zooming in a photo can be of great benefit when one is trying to capture a photo as "flat" - not wanting it to seem 3D. Professional Photographers usually do not zoom in to the maximum as this can make the photo seem grainy, and relatively less clear. </h4> 
		<h3> Flash</h3>
			<h4> Flashed photos are typically taken during night, or when it is dark (no lights...). However, there are other occasions on which flash photography can be used. For instance, if there is a shadow you would like to get rid of, flash can minimize the shadow darkness and even out the brightness of the photo. </h4> 
		<h3> Framing </h3>
			<h4> The frame of a photo is determined by the depth of field. It is the distance between the front most object in the photo and the object furthest away. </h4> 
		<h3> Shutter Speed </h3>
			<h4> Shutter speed is the length of time camera shutter is open, exposing light onto the camera sensor. It is responsible for two particular things: changing the brightness of your photo, and creating dramatic effects by either freezing action or blurring motion.</h4>
