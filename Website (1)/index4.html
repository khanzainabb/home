		<h3> Grain </h3>
			<h4> The grain feature is often used when wanting to give a photo an "old-styled" theme. It makes photos more pixelated just as they were in the past. </h4> 
				<img src = "grain.jpg" width = "400" height = "300" alt = "Photo of some faded pink flowers and the green leaves around them"  class= "center" />
		<h3> Saturation </h3>
			<h4> Also referred to as "chroma", saturation is the depth or intensity of color present within an image. It can make colours appear </h4>
				<img src = "grain2.jpg" width = "400" height = "300" alt = "A field, trees, the sky and clouds depicted in extremely saturated colours"  class= "center" />
		<h3> Tinting</h3>
			<h4> A tinted photograph is a photograph produced on dyed printing papers. This used to be done a lot in the past, through commercial manufacturers or a hand-colored photograph. However, now people simply edit photos through technology. It is when a single overall colour underlies the photograph. </h4>
				<img src = "tinted.jpg" width = "300" height = "450" alt = "This photo has been tinted with light blue and light purple shades. The original photo appeared to have different colours"  class= "center" />
		<h3> Cropping </h3>
			<h4> Cropping a photo reduces the photo size. It often cuts down parts of the image from different sides of the photo. </h4> 
		<h3> Vignette </h3>
			<h4> Vignette is a feature used to edit photos which creates darkness around the photo. It can be used when an entire photo is relatively bright, or when it is necessary to focus on the middle of the photo. </h4> 
				<img src = "flowers.jpg" width = "250" height = "400" alt = "Some pink flowers surrounded by green leaves" />
