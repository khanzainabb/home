		<h3> Long Exposure </h3>
			<h4> Through long-exposure, people capture photos with a slow-shutter. This helps to sharply capture the stationary elements of images while blurring or obscuring the moving elements. </h4> 
		<h3> Forced Perspective Photography </h3>
			<h4> Forced perspective is a technique which depicts optical illusions in order to make an object appear farther away, closer, larger or smaller than it actually is. In other words, it is a photo which may be deceiving to the eye. </h4> 
		<h3> Macro Photography </h3>
			<h4> Macro Photography captures images which are difficult to be seen in detail by the human eye. They are typically taken of insects. </h4> 
		<h3> Panoramic Photography </h3>
			<h4> Panoramic Photography uses specialized equipment or software in oder to capture photos with horizontally elongated fields of view. </h4> 
		<h3> Reflection Photography </h3>
			<h4> Reflection photography also known as mirror photography, is when one uses reflective surfaces to create an artistic echo of a scene. It can be done of nature and people. </h4>
