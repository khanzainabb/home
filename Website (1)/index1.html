		<h3> &para; Landscape Photography </h3>
			<h4> A form of photography which depicts nature as it is taken outdoors. It is typically taken with the camera framed in a landscape position in order to capture a broader perspective. </h4>
		<h3> &para; Wildlife Photography </h3>
			<h4> Wildlife photography is a genre of photography concerned with documenting various forms of wildlife in their natural habitat. Since wildlife are moving and unless they are pets, it is difficult to keep them in one spot - tripods are usually used for this form. </h4> 
		<h3> &para; Aerial Photography </h3>
			<h4> Aerial photography is the art of capturing photos of airplanes and other flying objects. It is derived from the word aerodynamics. These photos are typically not taken in a simple format. Instead, different photography techniques like stop motion animation are used. </h4> 
		<h3> &para; Action Photography </h3>
			<h4> Action photography depicts movement or action. It is typically photographed during sporting events. Like wildlife photography, it is difficult to capture as the people are moving. Thus, different photography techniques are used. At times, people can film slow motion videos and screenshot a good capture from it instead in order to reduce the blur. </h4> 
		<h3> &para; Portrait Photography </h3>
			<h4> Portrait Photography is when one captures a photo of himself/herself. Though it can be of another person. They are typically taken of oneself. Shadows, and different colours usually depict emotion in the photo. To elaborate, dark photos or monochrome photos (black and white), give a relatively gloomy or old-styled feel. While photos with bright colours and extreme contrast, portray relatively happy emotions. </h4>  
		<h3> &para; Wedding/Event Photography </h3>
			<h4> During weddings, people typically hire a photographer. Hence wedding photography is now classified as a form of photography. Additionally, event photography is similar to wedding photography as they typically capture the happy moments between groups of people. </h4>
